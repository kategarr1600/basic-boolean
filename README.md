# Boolean Operator Basics
Boolean operators are logic commands that can be used to expand or limit your database searches. There are three Boolean operators, and they should always be typed in capitals when entered in a search string to be recognized as a Boolean operator. 

***AND*** *narrows* search results. Using it instructs the database that you only want search results that contain all the words joined by AND. For example, the search string “Paris AND architecture AND medieval” will return results that only contain all three words. Records with only one or two of the terms will not show up in search results for that search string.  

***OR*** *expands* search results. Using it instructs the database that you want search results that contain one or more of the words joined by OR. The search string “Paris OR architecture OR medieval” will return results that address every possible combination of these terms. OR is best used in combination with AND to return useful results. 

***NOT*** *excludes terms* from search results. Using it instructs the database to exclude irrelevant results by targeting specific words or phrases. This is useful when a word has more than one meaning or when a closely related but irrelevant topic uses the same search terms. For example, if you want to exclude Paris from search results about medieval architecture, you could use “architecture OR medieval NOT Paris”.
